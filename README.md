The technological advancements made in the field of computer science have changed many of our day to day lives.But one of the most important applications would be in hospitals, particularly in the medical records of patients. According to the current scenario, there is no integrated application across various hospitals(both government and private) to maintain information on patients medical records which would enable patients(even in emergency situations) to visit hospitals without worrying about their medical records.


The solution is this “Patient Medical record management system” which would consistently maintain patients medical record information would help in solving this problem. Medical records of each patient would be updated as and when a patient goes for a checkup or treatment in any hospital he/she visits. These records can be accessed by certified professionals/ Recognized hospitals by entering a one time password which would be issued upon request to the respective patient. This ensures privacy for the patient as he/she can choose to not reveal the information.
